An archive of a sudoku solver from 2017, updated for clarity in terminal prompts.<br><br>

Sudoku.py takes in an input of a series of 81 characters represnting the values of a sudoku board going left to right and then top-down. Empty spaces should be represented with a period and the filled in spaces should be represented with the corresponding number (1-9). Do not put any special characters or white space except the 81 characters and press enter to get a ASCII image of the solved Sudoku board.
